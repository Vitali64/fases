## Mirrors

Development of fases is done on git.vitali64.duckdns.org but there are 
mirrors made by other people:

| Protocol | URL | Author |
|----------|-----|--------|
| git:// | [andrewyu.org](git://git.andrewyu.org/fases.git) | Andrew Yu |
| https:// | [notabug.org](https://notabug.org/vitali64/fases) | Ferass |

If you made a mirror too, be sure to let me know so I can add it on this 
section too!
