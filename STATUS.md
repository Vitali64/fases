*Simple coreutils for a fully functionnal UNIX-like system*

[Â« Go back](README.md)

## Status

The `fases` project is still incomplete as some utilities are missing, here's 
what `fases` currently provides (most of those utilities are incomplete):

- `ls`

- `head`

- `cat`

- `yes`

- `date`

- `mkdir`

Other utilities are still in the making. Help is greatly appreciated.

## Known bugs

The `fases` project is still a Work-in-progress and as such, there are bugs.
Please do report bugs to me, via IRC, email, or even by using Notabug.org 
issues.

| Bug                                          | Affected utility-ies |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------|
| Sometimes, `-l` would show incorrect permissions.           | `ls`  |
| When there's a lot to print, `-l` fails with a memory error | `ls`  |
