# fases - Ferass' Base System

*Simple coreutils for a fully functionnal UNIX-like system*

***Project Documentation***

- [Compile fases](COMPILE.md)

- [Mirrors](MIRRORS.md)

- [Status](STATUS.md)

- [Coding Style](CODING_STYLE.md)

- [Incomplete TODO list](TODO.md)

## Goal

The `fases` project tries to provide friendly, functionnal and simple core 
utilities for a fully functionnal UNIX-like Operating System. It tries to 
be entirely portable and working on any UNIX-like Operating System and kernel 
such as OpenBSD and Linux. It also tries to be completly modular and as such 
one utility should **not** depend on another in order to work. The coreutils 
are still a work-in-progress.

## Chat

The `fases` project has 2 IRC channels hosted on 2 IRCÂ Networks:

- `#fases` on `LibreIRC` ([webchat](https://kiwi.andrewyu.org/#fases)):

server: `irc.andrewyu.org` ;

ssl: `6697` (recommended) ;

plain: `6667`.

- `#fases` on `Libera.Chat` ([webchat](https://web.libera.chat/#fases)):

server: `irc.libera.chat` ;

ssl: `6697` (recommended) ;

plain: `6667`.

Both of these channels are linked so all messages sent in one of them 
is sent on the other Network.

## Mailing Lists

The `fases` project also has a mailing list ran by Andrew Yu (thanks!).

The mailing list's address is: ***fases -at- andrewyu -dot- org*** (
[archive](https://www.mail-archive.com/fases@andrewyu.org/)). If you want 
to subscribe to this mailing list, please ask on IRC.

## Thank you!

I would like to thank a few people there, mainly:

- Andrew Yu, for making a mirror on their git server at git.andrewyu.org, and 
linking the ##fases libera.chat channel to LibreIRC, for testing fases on
OpenBSD and for hosting the mailing list.

- Leah Rowe, for adding lots of improvements on her 
[git repo](https://notabug.org/vimuser/fases) and for testing fases on OpenBSD.

- Ron Nazarov, for fixing a weird bug in `yes` and adding useful features in 
it.

- Other people I forgot to add there. If I forgot to add you there, do send 
a patch or just tell me :D.

Contributions are very welcome, even if you're not a programmer. You can help 
this project by:

- Testing utilities and reporting bugs ;

- Talking about fases ;

- Giving me recommendations.

Help is greatly appreciated, thanks!
